## About me

### Hello!! My name is Alexander, I am 36 years old and now I am a student at Epam Upskill lab. I am currently teaching Frondend.

### I chose this direction because I like the visual part of the applications, when you can see the result of the work immediately.

### I have not any Frond-end development experience yet, but I have a great desire, mentor, a lot of free time and a training program for the next 3+ months.

### I am interested in learning new things.
